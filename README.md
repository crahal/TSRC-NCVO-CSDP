Now also contains a poster of an earlier version of the working paper presented at Data for Policy 2016 at the University of Cambridge.

Last Updated: 06/08/2017. To do list:

1. Fully debug 'full' match algorithm in Approximate_Functions.
2. Setup Approximate_Functions.py to run on [Cuda Python](https://developer.nvidia.com/how-to-cuda-python) (GPU processing) for performance increases.
3. Bring in some modular expansions, potentially like [Enamorado et al., 2017](http://imai.princeton.edu/research/linkage.html)
